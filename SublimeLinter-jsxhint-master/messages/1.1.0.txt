SublimeLinter-jsxhint 1.1.0
----------------------------

Added "Javascript 6to5" to syntax target list.

Removed bundled JSX syntax. Users should install sublime-react or 6to5-sublime packages instead, which are
properly maintained.

Added `config_filename` option. Set to e.g. `.jsxhintrc` to use a separate config file for jsxhint.
